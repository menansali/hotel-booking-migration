# üè® Hotel Booking and Management System ‚Äì Relational to NoSQL Migration

This project demonstrates the migration of a relational PostgreSQL database to a NoSQL MongoDB document store. It simulates a hotel booking system with guests, rooms, bookings, and payments, showcasing how a normalized relational model can be transformed into an embedded NoSQL model using Python.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Design a relational database with integrity constraints and relationships.
- Populate the database with realistic data.
- Choose and justify a suitable NoSQL database.
- Migrate the data programmatically from PostgreSQL to MongoDB.
- Translate relational models into document-based structures.
- Document and demonstrate the migration process.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### ‚úÖ Relational Model (PostgreSQL)

Tables:
- `guests`: stores guest details
- `rooms`: stores room info and pricing
- `bookings`: tracks room reservations
- `payments`: links to bookings with payment info

Relationships:
- Each booking links a guest and a room
- Each payment links to one booking

### ‚úÖ NoSQL Model (MongoDB)

Each document in the `guests` collection includes:
- Guest information
- Embedded array of `bookings`
  - Each booking includes room details
  - If available, embedded payment info
